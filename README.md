This repository may be used as a playground and allow you to be more confortable with _Git_ and _GitHub_'s processes.

You may fork it then:
* make modifications and create a pull request
* create branches and play with them
* see how original, fork and clone communicate and work
* see how Git and GitHub work together
* have a look at the `gh-pages` branch
